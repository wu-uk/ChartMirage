The bottom tier, “Housing delivery platform,” consists of a gray rectangular area divided into four components: Community engagement (managing stakeholders and qualifying beneficiaries), Funding (creating mechanisms to pursue all possible funding options), Delivery model (choosing locally appropriate delivery models), and Governance (building local governance with dedicated units, streamlined processes, and performance management).

The process begins with SARS-CoV-2 entering epithelial cells, triggering reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce cell death and activate intracellular pathways including NLRP3 and NF-κB. These signals initiate immune invasion, prompting macrophages to trigger activated T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, which release cytokines—specifically elevated IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ—culminating in a cytokine storm. This storm drives an inflammatory cascade that may lead to bacterial infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and ultimately multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, ending in death. Concurrently, tissue damage releases PAMPs and DAMPs that activate pattern recognition receptors (PRR), further amplifying cytokine production. On the right side, the diagram maps organ-specific clinical manifestations: lungs exhibit dry/productive cough, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, and fever; gastrointestinal tract shows nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and lower GI infection; brain symptoms include headache, impaired consciousness, confusion, stroke, muscle injury, anosmia, hypogeusia, and brain inflammation; cardiovascular system presents with palpitations, chest tightness, blood clots, heart attacks, and cardiac inflammation; liver shows raised AST; kidneys manifest oliguria, haematuria, proteinuria, and rapid blood pressure drop; microcirculation leads to hypoxemia; and eyes develop conjunctivitis. Arrows indicate unidirectional progression or activation, while bidirectional arrows between tissue damage and PRR activation suggest feedback loops. Components are grouped into stages: viral entry, immune response, systemic inflammation, and organ failure, with color-coded cell types (green for T cells, purple for macrophages, pink for neutrophils) and labeled anatomical illustrations.",

The vertical axis ranges from 0 to 1000 MtCO₂e, marked at intervals of 200. In 1990, total emissions exceed 850 MtCO₂e, composed of purple Transport (approx. 170), orange Buildings (approx. 130), yellow Electricity supply (approx. 160), light blue Manufacturing, construction & fuel supply (approx. 220), green Agriculture and land use (approx. 100), and dark blue Waste and F-gases (approx. 70). By 2018, total emissions drop to approximately 550 MtCO₂e, with each sector showing reduced contributions: Transport (~140), Buildings (~100), Electricity supply (~90), Manufacturing (~130), Agriculture (~60), and Waste (~30). The 2050 projection shows total emissions near zero, with all sectors approaching negligible values. A legend beneath the chart identifies each sector by color and label. The chart title states that emissions must fall in all sectors at a faster rate than in the previous thirty years to meet Net Zero, and a note clarifies that residual 2050 emissions will require offsetting via UK land use sinks and greenhouse gas removals.",

The Discovery phase begins with 31,969 individuals from 19 African American cohorts and 2 African cohorts, progressing through genotype pre-imputation quality control, imputation using the 1000 Genome Phase I reference, association analysis for SBP/DBP/PP/HTN traits, pre-meta-analysis QC, fixed-effects meta-analysis, multi-trait association analysis, and conditional independent analysis. From this, 72 independent SNPs with P < 1×10⁻⁶ are selected for replication. Three downstream analyses branch off: Pathway Analysis, Functional Annotation, and Cell Type Group Analysis, each represented by an oval node connected via gray arrows. The Replication phase incorporates four distinct cohorts—4,187 from African cohorts, 14,016 from East Asian cohorts, 23,914 from European cohorts, and 12,278 from a Hispanic cohort—which feed into a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. This yields 11 independent variants on 9 loci reaching P < 1.25 × 10⁻⁸ in the combined discovery and replication meta-analysis. Two final outputs emerge: eQTL Analysis and Hypertensive Mice Model, the latter highlighted with a gray outline around its oval node. All process steps are enclosed in rectangular boxes, while analytical outcomes are in ovals; directional flow is indicated by black downward arrows for sequential steps and gray diagonal arrows for branching analyses.",

From the culture, material flows rightward through three sequential processing steps: Concentration (represented by a triangular symbol), Drying (a rectangular box with horizontal lines), and Grinding (a conical mill icon). The output from grinding splits into two pathways: one leading to Extraction using Supercritical CO₂ in a vertical cylindrical vessel, and another directly to Transesterification in a stirred reactor vessel. Methanol is shown entering the transesterification step. The extraction stage produces a residue directed downward to Residue valorization, while its main output joins the transesterification output.

    "fake_caption": "FIGURE 4. Imports of lumber from countries other than Canada. Our experiences in the U.S. lumber market underscore the challenges facing Western mills today. We cannot rest our hopes on further demand improvements or economic growth to improve the industry's profitability. Instead, we must find ways to improve margins and control costs. And you can be sure that attention will be focused on lumber drying to meet those challenges. As strong as domestic markets for lumber were in 1997, the opposite was true for exports. The Asian economic problems and competitive changes in Japan have decreased American lumber export volumes last year, and our outlook for 1998 offers no respite from the decreasing volumes. Exports totaled 1.83 billion board feet in 1997, a 6.4 percent drop from the previous year. All of the decrease came in Asia, most notably Japan where shipment volumes were down by almost a third. Since Japan traditionally comprises about 40 percent of the export lumber purchases, its decline masked some good growth for American exports to Europe and Mexico. What's interesting is that the decline in Japan was due to a shift in supply rather than a market downturn. We're seeing more volumes from Europe coming into the Japanese market and that has begun to erode both the U.S. and Canada shares of the lumber trade. For 1998, we're not expecting any improvement in the Japanese trade and exports should dip another 9 percent to 1.67 billion board feet. Volumes to other countries should remain close to 1997 levels. Although foreign markets have reduced purchases of American lumber, there are still many Western mills doing good business in exports, often in the high-end lumber products. That's why at WWPA, we have developed a number of certification programs to help keep trade doors open for Western lumber. Recently, we developed a Kiln Drying Documentation program for Secondary Manufacturers. We just received the final approvals from the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and have started registering companies into the program.",

Its head is lowered slightly as if inspecting something below or resting, and the sunlight catches the edges of its fur, highlighting subtle gradations in tone. The bark on the branches appears rough and grayish-brown, with some smaller twigs extending outward, bearing oval-shaped leaves with smooth edges. No other animals or human-made objects are visible in the scene.",

Below the flag, near the bottom right corner, part of an arched stone doorway is visible, along with a carved stone plaque displaying the number “31” in raised numerals. A thin wire runs horizontally across the wall just beneath the flag’s hoist, and faint discoloration and texture on the stucco surface indicate age and exposure to the elements.",

Surrounding the open blossom are several unopened buds, tinged with pink and green, nestled among elongated, gray-green leaves that have a soft, fuzzy texture and serrated edges. The foliage forms a dense, blurred background, emphasizing the sharp focus on the flower and nearby buds, while thin stems support the blossoms and leaves in a natural, sprawling arrangement.",
